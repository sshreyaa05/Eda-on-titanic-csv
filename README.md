relationships between variables, and potential patterns.

## result:
## It shows 61.6% (549) person were not survived and 38.38% (342) person were survived.

## result:
## as we can see that there were more males were travelling in that ship as compared to female:
## male : 64.758698
## female : 35.241302
## 3. what is the percentage of the passanger classes in the dataset?

## result:
## as we can say that passenger class 3 had the highest percentage of travellers amongst all which is 55.106622%
## 4. Correlation : which variables are highly as well as minimally correlated?

## result:
## from the heat map we have come to know that :
## sibsp and parch has a high correlation of 0.41 ** adult male and alone has a high correlation of 0.40.
## 5. what is the average ticket price of the travellers based on from where did they mount?

## result:
## we can say that the average ticket price of passangers was higher in cherbourg which was 59.95 pounds and 27.24 pounds in southampton.
## 6. was there any significant relationship between the passanger class and those who were survived? and sibsp? and age, fare?

## 7. what was the average age of each passenger class and which one among them has the least average age?

## result:
## we can say that the passenger class 3 had the least average age among all the three classes.
## 8.  what were the average ticket price of each passenger class?

## result:
## we can say that the average ticket price of each passenger class is :
## 1 : 84.154687 pounds
## 2 : 20.662183 pounds
## 3 : 13.675550 pounds.
## 9.  how many people were travelling in that ship who did not have their parents or children travelling along with them?

## result:
## as we can see that 678 people were not travelling along with their parents and children.
## 10. what was the average age of the people who were alive and not alived after the shipwreck?

## result:
## from here we can draw a conclusion about the average age of the people who were alive(yes) and were not alive(no)
## no : 30.028233
